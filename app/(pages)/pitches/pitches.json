    "summary": "In this meeting, we learn about straddles and their function in hedging against volatility. We went over some macro events that happened this past week, which have been relatively calm compared to previous ones. Based on the contents of the meeting, we decided on a volatility play on Alphabet (GOOGL) due to its earnings release being close to the election, and we will establish a large position in straddles on the underlying stock (i.e., we are going all in).",
